<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a dedicated Software Engineering student at the University of Bahrain with a GPA of 3.93, currently ranked as a First Honor student. Passionate about technology and education, I combine strong technical skills with a deep interest in teaching and mentoring others. I currently work as a Discrete Math instructor at IT Learning, where I guide students through complex topics with clarity and enthusiasm.

Beyond academics, Iâ€™m the founder of SkySet, an innovative peer-to-peer tutoring platform designed to connect high-achieving student-instructors with learners who need academic support. My goal is to create accessible, high-quality education that empowers students to thrive.</p>

  <li>Frontend Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive UI design</li>
  <li>Programming & Logic: Java, MIPS Assembly, Python</li>
  <li>Database Systems: SQL, ER modeling, and normalization </li>
  <li>Software Engineering: Requirements analysis, system design, and UML modeling</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>I enjoy solving complex problems, explaining technical ideas simply, and building solutions that matter. My long-term vision is to develop impactful educational technologies that transform how students learn and grow.</p>
